## Get started

This repo holds tutorials, home-grown apps and unfinished experiments. Proceed with caution üêæ

No more need to install forge globally.
Just set the `.env` file and `cd` into the app directory. I customized the package scripts to work call the forge commands. In short:
```bash
yarn
cd JiPT3-CodeGen/
yarn
yarn build
yarn install
yarn tunnel
yarn forge <any_forge_cmd_you_want>
```

Or follow the not so elegant `npx` route.

- install [ForgeCLI](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/getting-started/#install-the-forge-cli)

Load the env into bash:
```sh
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs -d '\n')
```

Develope with docker and tunnel
```sh
npx forge tunnel
```

Set the secret API key:
```sh
npx forge variables set --encrypt OPENAI_API_KEY xxxxxxxxxx
```
